# House-Sales-in-King-County-USA-Homes-sold-between-May-2014-and-May-2015-
This dataset contains house deal costs for King County, which incorporates Seattle. It incorporates homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. In this project, I have Preprocessed the dataset(checking for missing values, duplicate values and deleting some attributes which are not useful), Performed some visualizations and Implemented Correlation Analysis to show which factors influencing the price of the house and what would be the important factors we need to consider before buying the house in that Area. Moreover, I also predicted the price of the houses using Random Forest Regression and Ordinary Least Square Regression techniques. Additionally, Conducted Hypothesis test for predicted value to determine the probability that a given condition is true and computing the p-value to know whether the null hypothesis is true or alternative is true.
